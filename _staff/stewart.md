bio: Hey y'all! I am a sophomore from central Virginia studying CS and English (or maybe MCM, who knows). I love watching movies and listening to music. If you ever have any recommendations please bring it up in hours! Outside of that, I enjoy hiking and camping, and this year I am hoping to get into rock climbing too.
