bio: Hi everyone!! I’m Iris, and I’m a senior from the deserts of Arizona. I’m studying Neuroscience and Computer Science, but it wasn’t until my junior year after taking CS0111 that I decided to concentrate in CS as well . Outside of classes, you can find me hammocking on the Quiet Green, searching for cool plants for my herbarium, or exploring cute coffee shops around Providence!
